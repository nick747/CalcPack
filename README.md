## Description

CalcPack is an all-in-one tool to solve algebra, geometry, finance and a lot of other problems.
I already developed a website called CalcPack and wanted to create an app for it too. But I've then discovered Flutter and I've set this product as an objective to learn more about it.
So CalcPack will be a web page hosted with Firebase (I hope) and a mobile app downloadable by an apk on the web version or simply on the repo (I still need to decide).

This project is still work-in-progress, while you wait for my lazy individual to complete it you can take a look at some snapshots of the old CalcPack:
